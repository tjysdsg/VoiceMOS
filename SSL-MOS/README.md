# Finetune SSL models for MOS prediction

This is code for our paper which has been accepted to ICASSP 2022:

"Generalization Ability of MOS Prediction Networks"  Erica Cooper, Wen-Chin Huang, Tomoki Toda, Junichi Yamagishi  https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02635

Please cite this preprint if you use this code.

## Dependencies:

 * Fairseq toolkit:  https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq  Make sure you can `import fairseq` in Python.
 * torch, numpy, scipy, torchaudio
 * I have exported my conda environment for this project to `environment.yml`
 * You also need to download a pretrained wav2vec2 model checkpoint.  These can be obtained here:  https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/wav2vec  If you are using the `run_inference_for_challenge.py` script, one will be downloaded for you automatically.  Otherwise, please choose `wav2vec_small.pt`, `w2v_large_lv_fsh_swbd_cv.pt`, or `xlsr_53_56k.pt`. 
 * You also need to have a MOS dataset.  Datasets for the MOS prediction challenge will be released once the challenge starts.

## How to use

Please see instructions in `VoiceMOS_baseline_README.md`
