=== README: VoiceMOS Challenge Test Phase Resources ===
=======================================================

This package contains the preprocessed audio samples for the test sets for the
VoiceMOS Challenge that we are allowed to distribute.

It also contains scripts to gather and preprocess the Blizzard Challenge samples.

Please read these instructions carefully.  You need to follow these steps to
obtain ALL of the data needed for the test phase of the challenge.


====================
=== DEPENDENCIES ===
====================

 * IMPORTANT: You must already have the data from the training phase of the
 challenge.  You must NOT have deleted anything in the phase1-[main,ood]
 directories.  If you deleted these directories already, then you must redo
 the main-phase data download steps.  The reason why is because the scripts
 gather audio samples that have already been downloaded in the 01_get.py script
 in the training phase of the challenge.  Since there are many Blizzard archives
 that take a long time to download, we set up the scripts with the intention
 that you wouldn't have to download them twice.

 * As for other dependencies, these are the same as before: Python 3.9, SoX,
 sv56, etc.


==================================
=== MAIN TRACK TEST PHASE DATA ===
==================================

1. Run `setup_main.py` and give it the path to your phase1-main directory as an
argument, e.g.:

   python setup_main.py /path/to/your/phase1-main

2. cd /path/to/your/phase1-main

3. Make sure you are using Python 3.9, and run:

   python 04_gather_test.py

4. Finally, make sure that sox and sv56demo are on your path, and run:

   python 05_preprocess_test.py


=================================
=== OOD TRACK TEST PHASE DATA ===
=================================

1. Run `setup_ood.py` and give it the path to your phase1-ood directory as an
argument, e.g.:

   python setup_ood.py /path/to/your/phase1-ood

2. cd /path/to/your/phase1-ood

3. Make sure you are using Python 3.9, and run:

   python 04_gather_test.py

4. Finally, make sure that sox and sv56demo are on your path, and run:

   python 05_preprocess_test.py


=========================================
=== NEW FILES AND DIRECTORY STRUCTURE ===
=========================================

Each of your separate phase1-main and phase1-ood directories should have the
following newly-added files in addition to the files that were already there:

phase1-[main,ood]:
|-- 04_gather_test.py      : script to select test set audio
|-- 05_preprocess_test.py  : script to preprocess test set audio
|-- DATA
    |-- sets
    |   |-- test.scp       : list of test set audio files
    `-- wav
        `-- [all wav files including new test set]

=== GOOD LUCK! ===
