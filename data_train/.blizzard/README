Congratulations!  You found the hidden data directory.

Please don't delete this directory.  You will need it later during other phases
of the challenge.  Since the data is hosted at Edinburgh and we are not allowed
to redistribute it, we don't want to spam their servers downloading the same
data many times.  Also, remember how long it took to download all this data?
You don't want to have to do that again, right?  So, please don't touch this
directory until after the challenge.

We would also like to remind you that looking at Blizzard data outside of the
sets that were compiled for the challenge is considered cheating.  That includes
the data in this directory.  Please use the processed data in the DATA/
directory instead.

We would like to emphasize that participation in this challenge is VOLUNTARY,
and that it is intended as a research community event to expand our collective
knowledge in the field of MOS prediction and to compare different approaches
fairly.  It is not a challenge for reverse-engineering the datasets.  Please
abide by the spirit of the challenge and do your part to maintain a community
that values research integrity and fairness.
